Newton iteration 1.
  X is a diagonal matrix.
    Line search step size chosen: 1.000000e+00.
  Objective value decreased by 3.256551e-06.
Newton iteration 2.
  Active set size = 5768.
  sub-gradient = 6.519012e-06, l1-norm of X = 3.031717e-03.
  Coordinate descent sweep 1. norm of D = 6.518917e-06, change in D = 6.518917e-06.
