Newton iteration 1.
  X is a diagonal matrix.
    Line search step size chosen: 1.000000e+00.
  Objective value decreased by 9.988112e-06.
Newton iteration 2.
  Active set size = 5768.
  sub-gradient = 2.000809e-05, l1-norm of X = 5.309481e-03.
  Coordinate descent sweep 1. norm of D = 2.000719e-05, change in D = 2.000719e-05.
