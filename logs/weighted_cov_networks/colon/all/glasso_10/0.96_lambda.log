Running QUIC version 1.1 in 'default' mode.
Newton iteration 1.
  X is a diagonal matrix.
    Line search step size chosen: 1.000000e+00.
  Objective value decreased by 3.929576e-06.
Newton iteration 2.
  Active set size = 9075.
  sub-gradient = 7.866989e-06, l1-norm of X = 3.806050e-03.
  Coordinate descent sweep 1. norm of D = 7.866911e-06, change in D = 7.866911e-06.
    Line search step size chosen: 1.000000e+00.
