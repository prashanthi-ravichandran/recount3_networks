Newton iteration 1.
  X is a diagonal matrix.
    Line search step size chosen: 1.000000e+00.
  Objective value decreased by 2.107450e-04.
Newton iteration 2.
  Active set size = 8179.
  sub-gradient = 4.237520e-04, l1-norm of X = 4.386917e-02.
  Coordinate descent sweep 1. norm of D = 4.235459e-04, change in D = 4.235459e-04.
