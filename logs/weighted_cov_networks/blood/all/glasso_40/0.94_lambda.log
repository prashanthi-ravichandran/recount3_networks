Running QUIC version 1.1 in 'default' mode.
Newton iteration 1.
  X is a diagonal matrix.
    Line search step size chosen: 1.000000e+00.
  Objective value decreased by 2.053731e-06.
Newton iteration 2.
  Active set size = 7805.
  sub-gradient = 4.110418e-06, l1-norm of X = 2.694200e-03.
  Coordinate descent sweep 1. norm of D = 4.110397e-06, change in D = 4.110397e-06.
