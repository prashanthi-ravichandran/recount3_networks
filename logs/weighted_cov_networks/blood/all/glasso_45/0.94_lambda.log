Newton iteration 1.
  X is a diagonal matrix.
    Line search step size chosen: 1.000000e+00.
  Objective value decreased by 4.225822e-05.
Newton iteration 2.
  Active set size = 7805.
  sub-gradient = 8.479652e-05, l1-norm of X = 1.222132e-02.
  Coordinate descent sweep 1. norm of D = 8.478754e-05, change in D = 8.478754e-05.
