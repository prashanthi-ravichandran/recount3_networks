Newton iteration 1.
  X is a diagonal matrix.
    Line search step size chosen: 1.000000e+00.
  Objective value decreased by 1.101472e-04.
Newton iteration 2.
  Active set size = 7805.
  sub-gradient = 2.214871e-04, l1-norm of X = 1.889171e-02.
  Coordinate descent sweep 1. norm of D = 2.214259e-04, change in D = 2.214259e-04.
