Running QUIC version 1.1 in 'default' mode.
Newton iteration 1.
  X is a diagonal matrix.
    Line search step size chosen: 1.000000e+00.
  Objective value decreased by 2.000888e-11.
Newton iteration 2.
  Active set size = 5767.
  sub-gradient = 1.185940e-12, l1-norm of X = 0.000000e+00.
  Coordinate descent sweep 1. norm of D = 1.185940e-12, change in D = 1.185940e-12.
    Line search step size chosen: 1.000000e+00.
  Objective value decreased by 1.818989e-12.
Newton iteration 3.
  Active set size = 5767.
  sub-gradient = 1.371792e-12, l1-norm of X = 0.000000e+00.
  Coordinate descent sweep 1. norm of D = 1.371792e-12, change in D = 1.371792e-12.
  Coordinate descent sweep 2. norm of D = 1.371792e-12, change in D = 0.000000e+00.
    Line search step size 1.000000e+00.
      Objective value would not decrease sufficiently: 1.818989e-12.
    Line search step size 5.000000e-01.
      Objective value would not decrease sufficiently: 1.818989e-12.
